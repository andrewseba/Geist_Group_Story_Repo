It all started when I drove my Porsche through a Baeckerei.
It wasn't my fault though, Rammstein on the radio had taken me over.
When I hear them, I have the irresistible urge to throw on my Lederhose and speed to the Ratskeller.
While I was okay, I'm still cleaning brot out of my Klimaanlage.
On top of it all, I forgot to buy the Gebaeck that I had gone there for.
But I did remember my twelve Brot from the store.
Unfortuately the schloss on my rental Audi broke, and I was chased home by a hungry hund.
When the hund left several hours later, I was able to sneak out and go to the Biergarten.
Once there, the drinking got quite wettbewerbsfaehig.
I wish it weren't the case, but this resulted in missing my flight to the Berlin Flughafen.
I decided to just sleep at the airport, but when I woke up I found myself in Munich.
Although I didn't have any money for food, I still had a few pocket bratwursts statshed away.
So I asked a fellow for a lift, but he said he was going to Raesfeld.
Instead, I decided to take off back home, walking down the Hauptstrasse.
It was there in the middle of the Haptstrasse a Klimaanlage fell out of the sky.
